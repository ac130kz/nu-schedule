# nu-schedule 0.0.3 #

This is a simple GUI application which utilizes the power of Python to help NU students with the time-consuming registration process.

## How do I get set up? ##

* Setup Python 3 environment and add it to the PATH, pip package installed.

* Install the required modules. In case of errors, run with root/admin permissions:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* Then just run the app
```
python3 main.py
```

## TODOs ##

* Implement __linking__ (binding R's together with L's for a specific teacher) 

	// Probably filter out the final results with a specific list or a GUI solution

* Create a __true__ database for more robust experience?
	 
* Make a compact executable (in short, force nuitka to work)
